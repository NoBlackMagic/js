Javascript Hello World
======================

JS code live into a <script> tag or it can link an external source file.
A page can contain more than one JS script.

JS is a complete programming language which means that makes things happen
into the web page. 

RUN THE EXAMPLE:
you need to run this example using Google Chrome and it's DevTools Console Panel
because "console.log" is a debug tool that does not come with every browser.

> many examples will output to the Console Panel
