Javascript - Conditionals
=========================

Conditionals allow a script to **take decisions**.

Mozilla Developer Network:
- [if/else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
- [switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)
- [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)

Interesting methods being used in the code below:
- [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.prompt)
- [parseInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt)
